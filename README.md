# download-yt

A Go application built with [Fyne](https://fyne.io/). Clone this repo and run `go build` or `build.sh` in `tools/` if you're on Mac OS.

Download any Youtube video with either just the video, audio or both.

**Note:** [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) is required to be installed on your computer before the app can filter out video/audio. Otherwise, the dropdown will be greyed out.
